# Welcome to Day Three! :D

# Agenda:
- CSS, HTML, Javascript review
- Brainstorming and iteration
- Build our first line chart
- Bar chart three ways
- Build your first bar chart

## Discussion: Review of CSS, HTML, Javascript

Let's examine the code we've already written, find where each of the three exist, and talk about what they're doing.

## Talk: Brainstorming and iteration

It's often one's instinct to take the first idea they come up with and run with it. However, because building things in d3 takes some time, we want to make sure we've thought through our design decisions before building anything. We're going to talk for a moment about the importance of [brainstorming](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/brainstormingRules.pdf) and iteration when building data visualizations.

To see a good example of brainstorming in action, see [this IDEO brainstorming video](https://vimeo.com/138588491).

## Your first D3.js line chart!

We will follow [these instructions](Projects&Exercises/FirstCompleteScatter/addingALine.md) to build off our scatter plot to create your first d3.js line chart.

## Bar Chart Three Ways:

[This exercise](Projects&Exercises/barChart3Ways/README.md) will look very similar to when we did our scatter plot three ways. The goal here is to reinforce the idea that d3 is merely manipulating DOM elements such as html tags, svg elements, and css stylings.

## Create our first full bar chart:

Now, let's [build our first bar chart from scratch](Projects&Exercises/FirstCompleteBar/README.md). Parts of this will look very similar to when you built the scatter plot, but others will be bar charts specific. Pay attention to these similarities and differences

## End of day discussion:

What questions do you have so far?

What we'll do next class:

**Before Next Class**

If you're having trouble with HTML, CSS, or Javascript basics, I would recommend doing the corresponding tutorial before next class.
