# Welcome to Day Two! :D

# Agenda:

- questions?
- debugging using the console,  `console.log()`, global variables, etc.
- finish our first Scatter Plot - add interactions!
- post to bl.ocks
- think about the D3 blueprint
- discuss readings and videos from last class
- if time, tackle bar charts
- end of day discussion

## Add styling and interactions to our scatter plot

First, we will finish up our static scatter plot [here](README.md) by:
  - loading in our data with `d3.csv`
  - formatting our x axis
  - adding gridlines and other stylings
  - adding a title
  
Then, we'll move on to adding interactions to our plot [here](scatterWithInteractions.md), which will include
  - hover interactions
  - creating buttons
  - updating data shown
  - utilizing `transition`, `duration`, and `ease`

## Post to bl.ocks

Now, we'll follow [these instructions](TechnicalSetup/blocks.md) to add our new visualizations to bl.ocks.org
