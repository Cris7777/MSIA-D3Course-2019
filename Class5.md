## Accouncement: Data Visualization Society Launch!

[Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks), [Amy Cesal](https://twitter.com/AmyCesal), and I launched the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/) on Wednesday. Here's [an article introducing the society](https://medium.com/data-visualization-society/introducing-the-data-visualization-society-d13d42ab0bec) and explaining why we felt it important to create this organization. If this is something you're interested in joining, you can do so [here](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/join).

At the time I wrote this (Thursday at 6pm), we had over 1,500 people already signed up. Very exciting!

## Review General Update Pattern

Let's take a look at the finished line/scatter plot with the general update pattern applied. 

## Hierarchy

Let's discuss hierarchy, when it applies, and some examples of d3 plots for which you need to format your data in a hierarchical way (using [`d3.nest`](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection#nests)). We'll start by looking at [this doc from last class](/Projects&Exercises/TreeMap/).

Some other examples:

- [sunburst](https://blockbuilder.org/EE2dev/4153ee8eafb5a27d32588b12877a0ea7)
- [circle packing](https://blockbuilder.org/mbostock/4063530)

## General Update Pattern Tutorial

Now, you'll get some practice playing around with the `enter`, `exit`, and `update` selections in [this General Update Pattern tutorial](/Projects&Exercises/generalUpdatePattern/genUpdatePattern_StarTrekLab.md).

## Add General Update  Pattern to Line / Scatter Plot

Take what you've learned about the general update function and apply it to the scatter / line plot we made previously so that it doesn't break when adding data for an incomplete year. Instructions [here](/Projects&Exercises/generalUpdatePattern/). 

## TreeMap 

Learn about hierarchy, `d3.nest`, and build your first TreeMap [here](/Projects&Exercises/TreeMap/)!

## Before Next Class

We have just one more class left. If there is something specific that you're having trouble with or that you'd like to learn more about, ping me on slack and let me know!

I'll poll the class about how far they got in their treemap in the event you need more time on that.
