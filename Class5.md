## Accouncement: Data Visualization Society Launch!

[Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks), [Amy Cesal](https://twitter.com/AmyCesal), and I launched the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/) on Wednesday. Here's [an article introducing the society](https://medium.com/data-visualization-society/introducing-the-data-visualization-society-d13d42ab0bec) and explaining why we felt it important to create this organization. If this is something you're interested in joining, you can do so [here](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/join).

At the time I wrote this (Thursday at 6pm), we had over 1,500 people already signed up. Very exciting!

## Review General Update Pattern

Let's take a look at the finished line/scatter plot with the general update pattern applied. 

## Hierarchy

Let's discuss hierarchy, when it applies, and some examples of d3 plots for which you need to format your data in a hierarchical way (using [`d3.nest`](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection#nests)). We'll start by looking at [this doc from last class](/Projects&Exercises/TreeMap/).

Some other examples:

- [tree map](https://blockbuilder.org/mbostock/8fe6fa6ed1fa976e5dd76cfa4d816fec)
