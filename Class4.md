## D3 Blueprint
As you've probably noticed, plots (especially common plots like bar, scatter, line, etc.) will often start the same way with similar starter steps. I want you all to take a moment now to think through all the steps necessary for creating a plot. This is something you can then use in the future when starting new. 

Let's add the steps to [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12V8c9BRft1uhFFTjg9c0sAucCfVVyho63fIsQqk8gdg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Scatter Plot with New Data

I've added a new dataset that includes January 2019 data. Let's look at what this does to the plot we created. (You can find the new data in the `General Update Pattern` folder.)

## Genearal Update Pattern Talk

We'll go through the basics of the general update  pattern in [this talk](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/General_Update_Pattern.pdf). 

## Genearal Update Pattern Tutorial

Now, you'll get some practice playing around with the `enter`, `exit`, and `update` selections in [this General Update Pattern tutorial]()

## End of day discussion:
