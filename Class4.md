# Welcome to Day Four! :D

## Agenda:
- d3 blueprint
- Scatter plot with 2019 data
- General Update  Pattern Talk
- General Update Pattern tutorial
- Fix the scatter / line plot
- First Tree map

## D3 Blueprint
As you've probably noticed, plots (especially common plots like bar, scatter, line, etc.) will often start the same way with similar starter steps. I want you all to take a moment now to think through all the steps necessary for creating a plot. This is something you can then use in the future when starting new. 

Collaborate with your classmates and add the steps to [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12V8c9BRft1uhFFTjg9c0sAucCfVVyho63fIsQqk8gdg/edit?usp=sharing). This is something you can look back on when reminding yourself where to start.

## Scatter Plot with New Data

I've added a new dataset that includes January 2019 data. Let's look at what this does to the plot we created. (You can find the new data in the `general Update Pattern` folder.)

## Genearal Update Pattern Talk

We'll go through the basics of the general update  pattern in [this talk](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/General_Update_Pattern.pdf). 

## Genearal Update Pattern Tutorial

Now, you'll get some practice playing around with the `enter`, `exit`, and `update` selections in [this General Update Pattern tutorial](/Projects&Exercises/generalUpdatePattern/genUpdatePattern_StarTrekLab.md).

## Add General Update  Pattern to Line / Scatter Plot

Take what you've learned about the general update function and apply it to the scatter / line plot we made previously so that it doesn't break when adding data for an incomplete year. Instructions [here](/Projects&Exercises/generalUpdatePattern/). 

## TreeMap

Create first TreeMap [here](/Projects&Exercises/TreeMap/)!

## Before Next Class

We have just one more class left. If there is something specific that you're having trouble with or that you'd like to learn more about, ping me on slack and let me know!
