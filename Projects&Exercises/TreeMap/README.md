## The Data

As William S. Cleveland puts it in [Visualizing Data](https://books.google.com/books/about/Visualizing_Data.html?id=V-dQAAAAMAAJ):

 > In the early 1930s, agronomists in Minnesota ran a field trial to study the crop barley. At six sites in Minnesota, ten varieties of Barley were grown in each of two years. The data are the yields for all combinations of site, variety and year, so there are 6 x 10 x 2 =120 observations.
